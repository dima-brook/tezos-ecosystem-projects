My Tezos Defi is a portfolio dapp that allows its users to track their investments on the Tezos blockchain.

With My Tezos Defi, users can see their token balances, get better insights about token statistics, check their vaults/ovens, and get essential information about their tokens staked in farms over multiple platforms, including the farm APR, the available rewards, and the total amount of staked tokens.  
In addition to tracking their investments, My Tezos Defi can also simplify users' interactions with the different platforms by allowing them to withdraw rewards and stake tokens in farms, as well as sending tokens from the dapp interface.
