XP.network is an ecosystem centered around the biggest NFT Multi-Chain bridge. The bridge connects Tezos ecosystem with 10+ EVM compatible chains (Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, xDai, VeChain, Velas, IoTeX, Aurora, Quarz, Moonbeam, Fuse, etc.) and numerous Non-EVM public ledgers, such as Algorand, Elrond, Tron, Secret Network (coming soon), Solana (coming soon), EOS (coming soon), etc. The bridge is accompanied by a [JS library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xp.network) allowing for seamless integration of its functionality in third-party dApps.
